# SimplePasswordGen
A simple password generator primarily for personal use.

The one in use here has decreased complexity as compared to the one personally used by me.

This version of the password generator takes a single global password, as well as the name of the application the password is being generated for, and creates a password for use on the site. This is achieved through uses hashes to create the new passwords, with the input generated by the multiple different information scrambled to create a new, unique, and ideally strong password that cannot be predicted without the initial inputs.

The hashes used are derived from the default hash function in python, and the simple gui is made with tkinter for increased visibility. Original design was to use the werkzeug.security library's hash generating functions, but was dropped in favor of increased simplicity.

This password generator uses pythons included hashlib to generate a repeatably consistent password generation, given that the intial inputs remain the same, without having to locally store any actual information given. It should be noted, however, that these passwords generated are not immune to brute-force attempts to break in,
