# SimplePasswordGen
A simple password generator primarily for personal use.

The one in use here has decreased complexity as compared to the one personally used by me.

This version of the password generator takes a single global password, as well as the name of the application the password is being generated for, and creates a password for use on the site. This is achieved through uses hashes to create the new passwords, with the input generated by the multiple different information scrambled to create a new, unique, and ideally strong password that cannot be predicted without the initial inputs.

The hashes used are derived from the default hash function in python, and the simple gui is made with tkinter for increased visibility. Original design was to use the werkzeug.security library's hash generating functions, but was dropped in favor of increased simplicity.

This is intended as more of a proof-of-concept than anything, and is not intended for real world use as the nature in how python by default randomizes the seet used to generate hashes causes results to be inconsistent. In the personal-use version the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable should be set to a static seed rather than the default random to allow for consistent results given the same inputs. This change is omitted from this proof-of-concept version of the program.
